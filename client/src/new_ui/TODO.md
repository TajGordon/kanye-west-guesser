# Future Improvements

- [ ] **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for events (points, input, correct/wrong, clicks). Architecture allows for `useEffect` hooks in `GameInterface` to trigger these.
- [ ] **Chat**: Add chat feature to the right sidebar (below player list).
- [ ] **Theming**: Expand `theme/index.js` to support multiple color schemes (Nord, Catppuccin) and allow user selection.
- [ ] **Animations**: Add transitions for screen changes and point updates.
- [ ] **Mobile Support**: Optimize layout for smaller screens (stack sidebars or use a drawer).
