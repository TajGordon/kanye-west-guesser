fix the deluxe edition stuff, or just add more info about the albums. deluxe edution album songs shouldn't be listed with the original albums date

make a program that lets me edit the album information, especially since the albums are current derived from the songs. maybe add like an id system, where ids point to an album, and thats where information is pulled from, making it easier to change. and there can be multiple ids pointing to same album for redudency or sm idk



do the stuff about how input can or cant be sanitised to like not have the punctuation required for answers, unless its on like strict


aliases should only apply for like asking "who said this" and should not apply for like "fill in the lyric"!!! whether aliases are allowed should depend on the strictness of the answer type.
