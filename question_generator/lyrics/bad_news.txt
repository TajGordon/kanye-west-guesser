[Verse 1]
Didn't you know I was waiting on you?
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know I was waiting on you?
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules?
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 2]
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you, how long have you known, dude?
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide to break the rules?
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Chorus]
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

[Bridge]
Oh, you just gon' keep another, no, you won't
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you

[Verse 3]
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
What's on the news?
